    LAMA - Location Aware Movement API - 2022 NinjaRacc

    This program is licensed under the GNU license.
    https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html

    The API will keep track of the turtle's position and facing, even across
    multiple games: the state is persistent. In particular it is very robust,
    i.e. even if the turtle is currently moving when it is forced to shut down
    because its chunk is unloaded, the coordinates will always be correct after
    it resumes. In theory, anyways. It's the only actually working approach I'm
    aware of, using the turtle's fuel level to check if it moved in such cases.

    The API is relatively basic, in that it is purely focused on movement. It's
    essentially a rich drop-in replacement for the the original navigational
    functions in the turtle API:
        turtle.forward   -> lama.forward
        turtle.back      -> lama.back
        turtle.up        -> lama.up
        turtle.down      -> lama.down
        turtle.turnRight -> lama.turnRight
        turtle.turnLeft  -> lama.turnLeft

    When using this API, you must not use any other functions that alter
    the turtle's position or facing. In particular:

        DO NOT USE turtle.forward, turtle.back, turtle.up, turtle.down,
        turtle.turnRight or turtle.turnLeft NOR THEIR NATIVE EQUIVALENTS.

    Any other external force changing the turtle's position will also
    invalidate the coordinates, of course (such as the player pickaxing the
    turtle and placing it somewhere else or RP2 frames).

    The utility function lama.hijackTurtleAPI() can be used to override the
    original turtle API functions, to make it easier to integrate this API into
    existing programs.
    When starting a new program it is recommended using the functions directly
    though, to make full use of their capabilities (in particular automatically
    clearing the way). See the function's documentation for more information.

    Moves the turtle to the specified waypoint.

    it will continue moving after booting up again. After it finished moving,

    the remaining startup scripts will be executed and the result of the move
    command can be queried via lama.startupResult().

    This just calls lama.moveto() with the waypoint's coordinates, which in

    @param name the name of the waypoint to move to.

        moving from (0, 0, 0) to (1, 0, 3), when this is true the turtle will
        move along the Z-axis first, then along the X-axis, if it is false the
        other way around.

    Replaces the movement related functions in the turtle API.

    This makes it easier to integrate this API into existing programs.

    The injected functions will NOT be the same as calling the API function
    directly, to avoid changes in existing programs when this is dropped in.

    For example: a call to turtle.forward(1) will return false if the turtle is
    blocked, whereas lama.forward(1) would try to destroy the block, and then
    move. The function replacing turtle.forward() will behave the same as the
